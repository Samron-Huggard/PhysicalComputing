            <h1>Sam's Assignment 1!</h1>

            For assignment 1, I made a metronome! It uses two blue LEDs to signify beats and put five green LEDs between them. I used higher value resistors
            for the green LEDs so they would have a lower current and be dimmer than the blue LEDs.

            Below is a close up of a schematic for an individual blue and green LED circuit. Respective currents are calculated below each. <br>

            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>
                
                1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs. <br>
                  Since there are many LEDs I have instead labeled lines when they are non-zero. <br>
                <img src="A1/A1graph.jpg" width=800></a> <br>
            <br>
                2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw? <br>
                    There are 14 I/O pins, so 14. If the current across each LED was 20mA, the total current going to ground would be
                    (20mA*14) 280mA. <br>
            <br>
                3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking? <br>
                    For me, around a 10 millisecond delay. <br>
